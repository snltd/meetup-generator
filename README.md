A very small, very stupid Sinatra app which generates a wholly plausible
agenda for a fictional DevOps meetup.

Now includes API!

```sh
$ curl -s localhost:4567/api/talk | json
{
  "talk": "Dockerizing Dockerized Docker with Docker for Docker Users",
  "talker": "David Thomas",
  "role": "Open Source Dragonslayer",
  "company": "prognosticatr.io"
}
```

Includes SMF manifest for your SunOS pleasure.

Pull requests welcome.
